# Diamond grid based on masonry's placement of items

A masonry based grid made up of diamonds ... diamondry if you will ;)

# To do
  - edit masonry so that it gives a class to rows every 4 (thomas, marco or patrick :D need ur help on that)
  - edit masonry so that it knows if there's an odd or even amount of objects in a row (again thomas, marco or patrick ^.^ )
  - Figure out if there's another possible way to do the huge diamond without needing 3 empty placeholder blocks  

#### And also:
  - Fill Diamonds with content and style it
  - Insert the whole thing in new website
  - Make it so wordpress can create new Diamond styled project, with exerpt, image, title, link and Diamond size normal or huge
