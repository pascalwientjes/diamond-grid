# Diamond grid based on masonry's placement of items

A masonry based grid made up of diamonds ... diamondry if you will ;)

# To do
  - edit masonry so that it handles big diamonds well within the grid (Patrick)
  - preferably edit masonry also that it gives a class name to grid items with a class that has the collumn number in it so something like "column1" etc.

#### And also:
  -
  - Insert the whole thing in new website
  - Make it so Wordpress can create new Diamond styled project, with exerpt, image, title, link and Diamond size normal or huge
